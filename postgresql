Use the SUM() function to calculate the total duration of all films and alias with total_duration

SELECT SUM(duration) AS total_duration
FROM films;

Update the query by adding ROUND() around the calculation and round to two decimal places.
SELECT title , ROUND(duration/60.0,2) AS duartion_hour
FROM films
